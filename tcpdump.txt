#setup 3 pc in netkit
vstart pc1 –-eth0=A 
vstart pc2 –-eth0=B
vstart pc3 –-eth0=C

Assign ipadd 
ifconfig eth0 192.168.11.1 "for pc 1"
ifconfig eth0 192.168.11.2 "for pc 2"
ifconfig eth0 192.168.11.3 "for pc 3"

On pc1
Ping 192.168.11.2

On pc2
tcpdump -i any #all traffic

On pc3
ifconfig
ifconfig eth0 promisc
Sets the eth0 network interface to promiscuous mode, allowing it to read all traffic flowing across the network segment, not just packets addressed to its MAC.

ifconfig
tcpdump -I any -n -xX host 192.168.11.2
Starts a detailed packet capture on pc3, filtering (host 192.168.11.2) to show traffic destined for pc2, thereby attempting to sniff the conversation between pc1 and pc2.



tcpdump is a command-line packet analyzer used to capture and inspect network packets in real time.
Promiscuous mode allows a network interface card (NIC) to capture all packets on the network segment, not just those addressed to it.

Why We Use It:
To analyze network traffic and troubleshoot connectivity or performance issues.
To monitor or detect attacks, unusual activity, or verify packet flow.

Promiscuous Mode: Enabled by default in tcpdump. You can verify using:
ifconfig eth0 promisc → enables promiscuous mode
ifconfig eth0 -promisc → disables it

Viva Questions:

Q: What does promiscuous mode do?
A: It allows a NIC to capture all packets on the network, not just those intended for it.

Q: What’s the difference between tcpdump and Wireshark?
A: tcpdump is command-line based, while Wireshark provides a GUI for deeper packet analysis.

Concept: The note mentions RSA, which is a type of Asymmetric Encryption. This method uses a pair of keys: a Public Key (which you can give to anyone) and a Private Key (which you must keep secret.

Why We Use It:
Confidentiality: Anyone can use your Public Key to encrypt a message, but only you can decrypt it with your Private Key. This is how HTTPS (SSL/TLS) works to secure websites.
Digital Signatures: You can use your Private Key to "sign" a document. Anyone can then use your Public Key to verify that the signature is authentic and came from you.

Your Experiment:
Your note mentions "RSA demo with p=211, q=233". These (p and q) are the two large prime numbers that are multiplied together to start the entire process of generating the public and private keys.
You are encrypting the name "Krish" using the public key and then decrypting the resulting ciphertext back to "Krish" using the private key, proving the system works.

Potential Viva Questions:
Q: What is the difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption?
A: Symmetric uses one single shared key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES). It's fast, but sharing the key securely is difficult. Asymmetric uses two different keys (public/private). It's slower, but it solves the key-sharing problem.


Monoalphabetic Cipher
A monoalphabetic cipher uses a single, fixed substitution rule across the entire plaintext message.
Substitution: Every occurrence of a particular plaintext letter is always replaced by the same ciphertext letter. This establishes a one-to-one relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext characters.
Security: These are generally considered less secure because the letter frequency patterns of the original language are preserved in the ciphertext, making them susceptible to frequency analysis attacks.
Cipher Examples:
Caesar Cipher (or Shift Cipher): Each letter is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet (e.g., A → D, B → E for a shift of 3).
Atbash Cipher: Letters are mapped to their symmetric counterparts (A → Z, B → Y, etc.).

Polyalphabetic Cipher
A polyalphabetic cipher uses multiple substitution alphabets that change during the encryption process, typically based on a keyword.
Substitution: The same plaintext letter can be replaced by different ciphertext letters depending on its position in the message. This creates a one-to-many relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext characters.
Security: These are significantly more secure than monoalphabetic ciphers because the changing alphabets break up the frequency patterns, making them much more resistant to frequency analysis.
Cipher Examples:
Vigenère Cipher: This is the most classic example. It uses a keyword to determine a series of Caesar shifts for each letter, cycling through the shifts with the key's length.
